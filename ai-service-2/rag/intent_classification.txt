SECTION B — HOW TO CLASSIFY A QUERY (RULES)

1) LOOKUP

latest load
show meter MTR001 data
load at 5 pm yesterday
reading at timestamp

2) TREND

how has load changed
trend for last week
show pattern over last 24 hours

3) AGGREGATION
total consumption
average load last week
sum of load this month


4) RANKING

top 5 meters by load
which feeder has highest load
zone with maximum peak

5) FILTERING

load above 20kW
humidity above 70%
meters with night usage

6) WEATHER_JOINT_ANALYSIS

load vs temperature
was humidity influencing load
does temperature affect consumption


7) ANOMALY_DETECTION

why sudden spike
detect abnormal readings
any unusual load last night


8) PEAK_CAUSE_ANALYSIS

why was yesterday’s peak so high
what caused the load spike
reason behind high load

9) SEASONAL_PATTERN

seasonal pattern
monthly trend
does summer load increase

10) CORRELATION_ANALYSIS

is temperature affecting load
is weather influencing usage
relationship between humidity and load


11) BILLING_ESTIMATION

predict next month bill
estimate bill for meter MTR003
cost calculation


12) FORECASTING

forecast
predict next 24 hours
future load
next day prediction

13) COMPARISON

compare feeder A and B
compare zones
which meter is more consistent


14) DATA DIAGNOSTIC / SANITY CHECK

is meter faulty
is this reading wrong
why missing values

SECTION D — INTENT DISAMBIGUATION RULES

RULE 1 — Causal wording always → analytics

“why”, “cause”, “influenced”, “affecting”

→ peak_cause_analysis or correlation

RULE 2 — Weather word present → analytics

temperature, humidity, rainfall, solar

RULE 3 — Forecast word present → forecast endpoint
RULE 4 — “highest”, “top”, “max”, “min” → SQL ranking
RULE 5 — “pattern”, “seasonal”, “monthly” → seasonal analytics
RULE 6 — “bill”, “tariff”, “cost” → billing_estimation
RULE 7 — Ambiguous → analytics fallback

SECTION E — EXAMPLES (VERY IMPORTANT)

Example 1

User: “Is temperature affecting load in North zone?”
→ Weather + effect → correlation_weather_load

Example 2

User: “What is the highest load this month?”
→ ranking → SQL

Example 3

User: “Forecast next 48 hours for meter 003”
→ forecast endpoint

Example 4

User: “Why did load spike yesterday evening?”
→ peak_cause_analysis

Example 5

User: “Does summer load increase compared to winter?”
→ seasonal_pattern

Example 6

User: “Find anomalies for last 10 days in East zone”
→ anomaly_detection



SECTION F — FINAL RULE FOR OUTPUT FORMAT

SQL → ONLY SQL
Analytics → ONLY JSON
Forecast → Do NOT output SQL, JSON only when needed
Never include explanations or commentary
