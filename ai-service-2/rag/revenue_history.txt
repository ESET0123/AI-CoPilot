REVENUE DATA (2010–2018)
==========================

Historical revenue values (in Crore INR):

2010: 11.5
2011: 12.4
2012: 13.1
2013: 14.0
2014: 14.9
2015: 16.2
2016: 17.8
2017: 19.3
2018: 20.1

Key Observations:
- Revenue shows a consistent upward trend from 2010 to 2018.
- Average YoY growth from 2010–2018 ≈ 7.5% to 8.3%.
- 2018 is the highest value (20.1 Cr).
- 2010 is the lowest (11.5 Cr).
- No negative revenue exists in the dataset.
- No year shows a decline; growth is monotonic.

ANALYSIS — YEAR OVER YEAR (YOY) GROWTH
================================================================================

YOY Growth Formula:
YOY Growth (%) = ((Revenue(current year) - Revenue(previous year)) / Revenue(previous year)) * 100

Computed YOY growths:
2011: +7.82%
2012: +5.64%
2013: +6.87%
2014: +6.43%
2015: +8.72%
2016: +9.88%
2017: +8.43%
2018: +4.15%

Insights:
- Peak growth occurred in 2016.
- Slowest growth occurred in 2018.
- Revenue growth stabilizes within 5–10% yearly.
- This dataset is ideal for linear or polynomial forecasting.

================================================================================
CAGR ANALYSIS (2010 → 2018)
================================================================================
CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) Formula:
CAGR = (EndingValue / BeginningValue)^(1 / NumberOfYears) - 1

Using:
BeginningValue = 11.5 (2010)
EndingValue = 20.1 (2018)
Years = 8

CAGR ≈ 7.8%

Meaning:
If revenues grow at a constant 7.8% every year, the company reaches 20.1 Cr by 2018.

================================================================================
EXPECTED FUTURE REVENUE (2019 → 2030) — BASED ON HISTORICAL TREND
================================================================================
Expected future growth scenarios:

Scenario A — conservative (6% YOY)
Scenario B — moderate (8% YOY)
Scenario C — aggressive (10% YOY)

General future revenue estimation logic:

Future Revenue(year) = LastKnownRevenue * (1 + growth_rate)^(YearsAfter2018)

This helps the LLM when user asks:
- "Forecast revenue for 2030"
- "Estimate income next year"
- "Projected sales in 2027"
- "Expected revenue for the coming year"

Example projected values at 8% growth:

2019: 21.7 Cr  
2020: 23.4 Cr  
2021: 25.3 Cr  
2022: 27.3 Cr  
2023: 29.5 Cr  
2024: 31.9 Cr  
2025: 34.5 Cr  
2026: 37.3 Cr  
2027: 40.3 Cr  
2028: 43.6 Cr  
2029: 47.1 Cr  
2030: 50.9 Cr  

These are ESTIMATES — not actual historical values.

================================================================================
COMMON USER QUESTIONS AND HOW THEY SHOULD BE ANSWERED
================================================================================

User may ask:
1. "What was revenue in 2016?"
→ Answer using historical data: 17.8 Cr.

2. "Which year had highest revenue?"
→ 2018 had highest (20.1 Cr).

3. "Did revenue ever decline?"
→ No decline observed from 2010–2018.

4. "What is the average revenue for the period?"
→ Mean ≈ 15.4 Cr.

5. "Predict revenue for 2030."
→ Use growth-based projection or ML model output.

6. "Revenue next year?"
→ Next year = current_year + 1 (use forecast logic).

7. "What is CAGR?"
→ ~7.8%.

8. "Revenue trend summary?"
→ Continuous increase, stable 6–9% annual growth.

================================================================================
CORNER CASES — WHAT THE MODEL MUST HANDLE
================================================================================

CASE A — Query for years NOT in dataset:
Example: “Revenue in 2045?”
→ Since data doesn't exist, LLM must estimate via trend.

CASE B — Ambiguous wording:
“Income”, “Sales”, “Earnings”, “Topline”, “Turnover”
→ All treated as revenue during semantics.

CASE C — Missing year:
“What is the expected revenue?”
→ LLM must ask or infer (e.g., next year).

CASE D — Wrong range:
“Revenue between 2050–2100”
→ No data; only trend-based extrapolation possible.

CASE E — Multi-part queries:
“Show revenue for 2015 and also predict for 2027.”
→ Use 2015 actual + forecasting logic for 2027.

CASE F — Decline or loss:
“Was revenue ever negative?”
→ Answer: No, dataset contains only positive revenues.

CASE G — Asking for partial periods:
“Revenue in Q2 2016”
→ Dataset is annual only → cannot provide quarterly.

================================================================================
BUSINESS GLOSSARY — TO AVOID CONFUSION
================================================================================

Revenue = Total income  
Income = Revenue  
Sales = Revenue  
Earnings = Revenue  
Turnover = Revenue  
Topline = Revenue  
Profit ≠ Revenue (do NOT hallucinate profit)  
Growth = YoY or CAGR depending on context  

================================================================================
CONCLUSION / GUIDELINES FOR LLM
================================================================================

- ALWAYS answer historical-year queries using the actual dataset (2010–2018).
- ALWAYS answer future-year queries using trend-based forecasting.
- If year missing → assume “next year” unless user clarifies.
- Never invent revenue values for years 2010–2018.
- Never confuse revenue with profit.
- Use the glossary to understand synonyms.
- Use the monotonic growth pattern to handle unexpected questions.
